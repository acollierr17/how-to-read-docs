# Read The Docs - Messaging A Random User From a Reaction
Choose a random user who reacted to an emoji and DM them.

How we will achieve this:
* [x] Get all [users](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/ReactionUserManager) on a particular [message reaction](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/MessageReaction)  
* [x] Choose a random user on that message reaction  
* [x] [DM](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/User?scrollTo=send) the random [user](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/User)
